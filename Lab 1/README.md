# comp2510 Lab 1
* Finished January 12, 2023

### Objective
* Write a function that prints out a multiplication table for numbers starting from 0 to n

### What I Learned
* This is my first assignment in C right after a 15-week term of Java. A lot of the syntaxes are the same, I just have to adjust to working with the command line.
