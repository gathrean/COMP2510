# comp2510 Lab 2
* Finished January 19, 2023

### Objective
* Write a function that rotates an array. 

### What I Learned
* This was more of a review of Java 2D arrays from the end of my previous term (COMP 1510). I remembered to use nested for loops.
* I learned how to rotate an array by multiples of 90 by transposing and flipping the arrays.
